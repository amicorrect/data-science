School of Computer, Data and Mathematical Sciences COMP 7006 Data Science Computer Based Assignment – PART A Spring, 2024

SCENARIO Recent public health data indicate a troubling increase in kidney disease rates within specific suburban areas, attracting significant attention from public health practitioners. Determined to uncover the root causes and identify actionable risk factors to address this issue, the public health team has embarked on a comprehensive study. They have collected patient records and relevant information on medical factors and water quality, as provided in the dataset.

Identify the target variable and clearly specify the research question.
Understand the data and perform the necessary data pre-processing. Clearly explain the steps taken. [Hint: data cleaning, make sure to divide the data into training and test set etc.,]
Perform a thorough data exploration using the provided dataset. You may use various visualization techniques (such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, correlation matrices, etc.) to uncover significant patterns and insights. Interpret your outputs and discuss key findings. [Hint: You may use as many plots as necessary and make sure to interpret them.]
Use logistic regression to answer the research question. Clearly explain the process or all the steps involved [Hint: model building, model improvement, evaluation]
Give your resultant model.

Build a logistic regression model incorporating polynomial terms. Clearly outline and explain each step of the process involved
Give the resultant accepted model (i.e. write the model equation) based on your findings above. Justify your answer clearly!
Use decision tree model to answer the research question. Clearly outline and explain each step of the process involved
Give the resultant model and interpret it. Clearly describe the terminal nodes [i.e. list the profiles].
Compare the different resultant models (Part A Question 5, Part B Question 2 and Question 4) you obtained above
